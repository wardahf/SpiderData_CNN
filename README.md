# SpiderData_Classification Using Deep Learning Transfer-Model

 In this spider model, i am using 15 different types of spider image dataset to design a Transfer Learning to predict 
 the test images.
 Using the MobileNet from keras applications as base model, by making modeifications in convolutional layers and designing Dense Layer architecture, my model accuracy is
 around 90%
